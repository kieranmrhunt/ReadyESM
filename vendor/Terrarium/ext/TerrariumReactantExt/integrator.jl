# Compiled time stepping.
#
# `run!` on a device integrator compiles the whole stepping loop into a single StableHLO
# program (via `@trace for`) and runs it. The compiled function can be reused across runs by
# passing it back as the `compiled_run!` keyword. The traced loop body calls the timestepper-level
# `timestep!` (`timestep!(integrator, timestepper, Δt)`), which is NOT overridden here — this is
# what avoids recursively re-entering the compiling wrapper.

const ReactantIntegrator{NF} = ModelIntegrator{NF, <:RARCH} where {NF}

# Reactant specialization of `Terrarium.run_timesteps!` (generic host loop defined in src). Here
# `Reactant.@trace` compiles the loop to a single `stablehlo.while` (rather than unrolling `Nt`
# copies of the step into the trace); this is the function compiled by `run!` and mirrors
# Oceananigans' `run_timesteps!` test helper.
#
# `checkpointing` is forwarded to `@trace` and controls reverse-mode-AD memory: `false` (default)
# stores every intermediate state; a scheme such as `Reactant.Periodic(n)`/`Reactant.Binomial(n)`
# stores only `n` checkpoints and recomputes the rest. It has no effect on a pure forward run but
# matters when this function is differentiated (see the autodiff example).

    run!(integrator; steps, period, Δt, checkpointing = false, compiled_run! = nothing)

Run a `ReactantState` integrator. If `compiled_run!` is `nothing`, the stepping loop is compiled
here with Reactant (`raise=true` lowers the KernelAbstractions kernels — halo fills,
tendency/closure kernels — so their traced grid/array arguments are adapted correctly).
The compiled function is returned-through by being reusable: pass it back as `compiled_run!` on
subsequent runs with the same `Δt`, step count, and `checkpointing` to skip recompilation.

`checkpointing` selects the reverse-mode-AD checkpointing strategy for the traced loop — `false`
(default), or a scheme such as `Reactant.Periodic(n)`/`Reactant.Binomial(n)`. It has no effect on
a forward run but bounds the memory of a reverse pass when the compiled function is differentiated.
