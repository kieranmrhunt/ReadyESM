    $TYPEDEF

Newton root-finder that always performs a *fixed* number of iterations, with the iteration count
carried in the type so that the iteration is a compile-time constant and the loop unrolls into
straight-line code.

Unlike [`RootSolver`](@ref) and [`FixedPointSolver`](@ref) there is no convergence test and hence no
data-dependent loop bound. That matters in two places:

- **Reactant**: a convergence-tested loop lowers to an `scf.while` with a dynamic trip count, which the
  StableHLO raise pass cannot lift. An unrolled loop raises cleanly.
- **Reverse-mode AD**: a fixed trip count avoids a dynamically-sized tape.

TODO: In the future, Reactant should just use the regular solvers.
