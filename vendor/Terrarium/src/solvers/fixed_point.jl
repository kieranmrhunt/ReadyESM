    $TYPEDEF

Fixed-point (Picard) iteration solver. Repeatedly applies the update `g(x) = x - F(x)`, where
`F` is the residual returned by the [`ObjectiveFunction`](@ref), optionally under-relaxed via a
[`RelaxationFactor`](@ref), until the change in the iterate falls below `tolerance` or
`max_iterations` is reached.
