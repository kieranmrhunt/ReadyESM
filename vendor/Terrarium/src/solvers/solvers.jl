    $TYPEDEF

Represents an objective function for nonlinear solvers. The name `target`
refers to the output `Field` which should updated on each iteration. The
objective function should have the signature
```julia
func(out, indices..., grid, fields, func_args...; func_kwargs...)
```
where `indices` are the grid indices passed to [`solve!`](@ref) and directly
return the scalar residual. If an analytical derivative is provided via `dfunc`,
it should follow the same signature as `func` and return the derivative of
the residual with respect to the target.

Solve the nonlinear problem defined by `objective_func!` for its `target` field at the given
`indices`, mutating `out` in place. The objective returns the residual `F(x)` whose root is
sought; on return, the target field holds the converged estimate and the method returns the
root (and, for some solvers, the number of iterations performed). Dispatches on the concrete
`solver` type, e.g. [`RootSolver`](@ref), [`NewtonSolver`](@ref) or [`FixedPointSolver`](@ref).
