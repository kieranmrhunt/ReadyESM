    $TYPEDEF

Coupled vegetation process representing natural vegetation with a *prescribed* leaf area index. Unlike
[`VegetationCarbonCycle`](@ref), the vegetation carbon pool and leaf area are not prognostic: leaf area
index is imposed externally (via the [`PrescribedPhenology`](@ref) scheme) and drives photosynthesis,
stomatal conductance, and the associated water/energy exchange. There is consequently no prognostic
carbon-pool or vegetation-dynamics component and no autotrophic respiration; `compute_tendencies!` is a
no-op. Plant functional-type parameters (including the maximum leaf area index used to derive the
phenology factor) are supplied through the `traits` component.
