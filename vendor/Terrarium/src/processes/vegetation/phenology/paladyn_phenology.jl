Prognostic, growing-degree-day (GDD) based vegetation phenology following the cold-deciduous scheme of
[willeitPALADYNV10Comprehensive2016](@cite) and [sitchEvaluationEcosystemDynamics2003](@cite).

The instantaneous leaf area index is `LAI = ϕ·LAI_b`, where `LAI_b` is the balanced (annual-maximum)
leaf area index and `ϕ` is the phenology factor. For a cold-deciduous PFT, `ϕ` ramps up linearly with
accumulated growing degree days above a base temperature `T_gdd_base` at a rate set by `gdd_crit`
[willeitPALADYNV10Comprehensive2016; Eq. (83)](@cite), holds at 1 once fully leafed out, and declines
linearly during senescence as air temperature falls from `T_gdd_base` to `T_gdd_base − T_senescence_range`.

Unlike the discrete daily accumulation of the original scheme in PALADYN, the growing degree days are integrated as
a prognostic state variable, so no history of past inputs needs to be stored. To recover a periodic seasonal
cycle without a discrete annual reset (which would violate the continuous-time design), a cold-season
relaxation term drains the accumulator with timescale `gdd_relaxation_time` whenever air temperature is
below `T_gdd_base`.

The deciduous/evergreen distinction, set in PALADYN by the coldest-month temperature, is represented here
by the prescribed `f_deciduous` fraction: `ϕ = f_deciduous·ϕ_deciduous + (1 − f_deciduous)`, so an evergreen
PFT (`f_deciduous = 0`) has `ϕ = 1` (and `LAI = LAI_b`) independent of temperature.

Compute the phenology factor `ϕ` [-] from accumulated growing degree days `gdd` and air temperature `T_air`.

The cold-deciduous factor combines the growth-phase ramp `gdd / gdd_crit`
[willeitPALADYNV10Comprehensive2016; Eq. (83)](@cite) with a senescence ramp that declines linearly from 1
at `T_gdd_base` to 0 at `T_gdd_base − T_senescence_range`. Taking the minimum reproduces all three PALADYN
regimes (linear green-up, held at 1 when mature and warm, temperature-driven senescence). The result is then
blended with the evergreen value of 1 via the prescribed deciduous fraction.
