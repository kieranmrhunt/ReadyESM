    $TYPEDEF

Simple fractional snow cover parameterization `f_snow = W_snow/(W_snow + W_ref)` where `W_snow` is the
current snow water equivalent (SWE) within any given finite area and `W_ref` is the reference
SWE at which the area would be expected to be 50% covered. The function is smooth and differentiable,
with `f_snow → 0` as `W_snow → 0` and `f_snow → 1` as `W_snow → ∞`.

Default SWE level for `half_coverage` is set to 0.01 m following [douvilleNewSnowParameterization1995](@cite).
