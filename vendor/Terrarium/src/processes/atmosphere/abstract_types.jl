# Parameterization types

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for representations of near-surface atmospheric humidity. Subtypes define
which form of humidity (e.g. specific or relative humidity) is used as input.
"""
abstract type AbstractHumidity end

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for representations of atmospheric precipitation. Subtypes define which
variables describe the precipitation input (e.g. rain and snow as separate fields).
"""
abstract type AbstractPrecipitation end

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for representations of downwelling (incoming) radiation. Subtypes define which
spectral components are provided as inputs (e.g. split into shortwave and longwave).
"""
abstract type AbstractIncomingRadiation end

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for representations of wind input fields. The target input variable is
[`windspeed`](@ref) but subtypes may define different input formulations (e.g. u/v component velocities).
"""
abstract type AbstractWind end

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for aerodynamic parameterizations that compute the bulk drag coefficient
for turbulent heat and moisture exchange between the land surface and atmosphere.
"""
abstract type AbstractAerodynamics{NF} end

# Process types

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Base type for representations of the atmosphere that provide meterological state
variables such as air temperature and pressure, humidity, precipitation, incoming
solar radiation, gas concentrations, wind speed, and near-surface aerodynamics.
