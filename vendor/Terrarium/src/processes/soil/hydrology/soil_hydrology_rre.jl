    RichardsEq{PS} <: AbstractVerticalFlow

[`SoilHydrology`](@ref) flow operator implementing the mixed saturation-pressure form
of the Richardson-Richards equation.

State variables defined by the Richards' formulation of `SoilHydrology`:

- `saturation_water_ice`: saturation level of water and ice in the pore space.
- `surface_excess_water`: excess water at the soil surface (m^3/m^2).
- `hydraulic_conductivity`: hydraulic conductivity at cell centers (m/s).
- `water_table``: elevation of the water table (m).
- `liquid_water_fraction`: fraction of unfrozen liquid water in the pore space (dimensionless).

See also [`SoilSaturationPressureClosure`](@ref) and [`AbstractSoilHydraulics`](@ref) for details regarding the
closure relating saturation and pressure head.
