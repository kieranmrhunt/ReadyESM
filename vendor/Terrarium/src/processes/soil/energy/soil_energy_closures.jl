    $TYPEDEF

Defines the constitutive relationship between the the internal energy and temperature of a
soil volume, i.e.
```math
U(T) = T\\times C(T) - \\rho_w L_{sl} \\theta (1 - F(T))
```
where T is temperature (°C), C(T) is the temperature-dependent heat capacity (J/m³/K),
ρ_w L_{sl} θ is the volumetric latent heat of fusion (J/m³),  and F(T) = θ_w/θ is the constitutive
relation between T and the unfrozen fraction of pore water with θ the sum of the volumetric fractions of water and ice.
Note that, under this formulation, zero energy corresponds to 0°C with no ice, i.e. all pore water fully thawed.

The closure relation is defined as being a mapping from the conserved quantity (energy) to the continuous
quantity (temperature), i.e. the inverse of U(T).
