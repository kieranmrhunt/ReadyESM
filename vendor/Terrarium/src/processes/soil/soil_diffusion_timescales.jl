    $TYPEDSIGNATURES

Return the minimum thermal diffusion timescale ``τ = Δz² C / κ`` over the soil column for the
`SoilThermodynamics` energy process, where `κ` is the bulk thermal conductivity (W m⁻¹ K⁻¹) and `C`
the bulk volumetric heat capacity (J m⁻³ K⁻¹). This is the diffusive stability limit of the explicit
heat conduction operator, whose effective temperature diffusivity is ``α = κ / C``.

The sensible heat capacity is used (not the apparent capacity, which includes the latent heat of
phase change); since the apparent capacity is never smaller, the reported timescale is conservative
near the freezing front.

"""
    $TYPEDSIGNATURES

Return the minimum hydraulic diffusion timescale ``τ = Δz² (∂θ/∂ψ) / K`` over the soil column for a
Richards-equation `SoilHydrology`, where `K` is the (variably saturated) hydraulic conductivity
(m s⁻¹) and `∂θ/∂ψ` the specific moisture capacity (m⁻¹). This is the diffusive stability limit of
the explicit Richards operator, whose effective moisture diffusivity is ``D = K ∂ψ/∂θ = K / (∂θ/∂ψ)``.

As the soil saturates, ``∂θ/∂ψ → 0`` and the timescale tends to zero: explicit Richards is stiff
near saturation, which is precisely the regime motivating implicit timestepping. The
`TimeStepWizard`'s `min_change` bound keeps the step from collapsing to zero in a single adjustment.
